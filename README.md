# ai-agents-in-langgraph


this is a note of course [ai-agents-in-langgraph](https://www.deeplearning.ai/short-courses/ai-agents-in-langgraph/) by Harrison Chase and Rotem Weiss.

## modifications
* in first lesson, Harrision used OpenAI client, I used Yi instead which uses exact same API as OpenAI. if you are in China, you can use Yi instead of OpenAI.

## useful sites

* langchain hub

    where you can find prompt templates.
e.g. in lesson 1, Harrison used ['hwchase17/react'](https://smith.langchain.com/hub/hwchase17/react).

## comments
* lesson 2

    The LLM model in Lesson 2 is best implemented using GPT, as other large models do not perform well. Additionally, the code needs modification as it is currently compatible with the OpenAI API.
    
    I'll modify this code to adapt other LLMs in future.
